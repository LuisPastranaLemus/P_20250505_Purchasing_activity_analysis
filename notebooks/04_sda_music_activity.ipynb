    "## 4. Conclusion of Statistical Data Analysis – Music Activity\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis aimed to assess user music activity patterns across different cities and days of the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics highlighted clear differences in user behavior, with Springfield consistently showing higher user engagement metrics compared to Shelbyville.\n",
    "\n",
    "A T-test confirmed that the difference in total tracks between Springfield and Shelbyville is statistically significant, indicating user activity is not equal across cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the two-way ANOVA test conducted on user music activity data, we assessed the influence of two categorical variables — city and day of the week — along with their interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistical results indicated that city has a significant effect on user activity (measured through track counts).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the variation across days of the week and the interaction between city and day did not yield statistically significant differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings seem to contrast slightly with the exploratory data analysis (EDA), which visually suggested small differences in user activity between days (e.g., Friday vs. Wednesday). This apparent discrepancy can be explained by the fact that visual analysis captures perceived trends, while statistical tests quantify whether such trends are strong enough to rule out random variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support the validity of the ANOVA assumptions, Levene’s test for equality of variances was not considered. In two-way ANOVA, this assumption still matters; however, Levene’s test becomes more complex due to the interaction of two factors. Unlike one-way ANOVA (with one grouping variable), two-way ANOVA involves multiple group combinations (e.g., combinations of city × day). That means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Levene’s test would need to check all combinations of the two categorical variables.\n",
    "- If variances differ significantly across these subgroups, a Welch’s ANOVA or generalized linear model (GLM) is preferred."
